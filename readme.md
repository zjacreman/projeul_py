# Project Euler solutions in Python

Zachary Acreman <zakk@acreman.net>

## What? Why?

This repo contains my solutions to various Project Euler problems. It
is on github as a personal code sample and example of my project
solving methodology. Most of the files are commented as appropriate.

Everything in the repo is revised for python 3.

## Don't cheat

Don't use these code files to cheat on Project Euler. That would be
super lame. Don't force yourself to live the rest of your life with
the knowledge that you suck.

## Noteworthy examples

In Problem 1, I solve the same simple problem multiple ways to test
the performance of various advanced Python syntactic conventions.

Problem 11 includes some nifty list-of-lists grid traversal, lambdas,
and first-class function passing.

Problems 14, 18, and 67 feature dynamic programming/memoization.

Problem 15 includes a very detailed, literate programming-style
walkthrough of the solution.
